## What is `lyMixture`?

This package is an extension to the [`lymph`] package, which models lymphatic tumor progression in head and neck cancer.

However, different tumor locations/subsites may exhibit different spread patterns. This extension to the original model attempts to model this as a mixture of several components that might represent something like the atomic spread patterns.

This code was originally written by [Julian Brönnimann] as part of his Master's thesis in the medical physics research group of Prof. Jan Unkelbach at the University Hospital Zurich. It was subsequently adapted and extended to match the [`lymph`] API as closely as possible.
